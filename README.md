# CSAMusicStudio
This is an SQL database designed for a music teaching studio.

CSAMusicStudio is a place to keep track of all the various data gained through teaching musical instruments to students.  This allows the teacher to stay more organized and be able to see, at a glance, many different facets of the music studio business and teaching.

The intention with this project was to get practice with SQL.
